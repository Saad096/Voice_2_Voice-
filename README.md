# Real-Time Voice-to-Voice Chatbot
This project implements a real-time voice-to-voice chatbot using Gradio, Whisper, and the Groq API. The application accepts voice input from the user, transcribes it to text using Whisper, generates a conversational response using the Groq language model, and converts the response back to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
### Features
    1. Speech-to-Text Conversion
        ◦ Converts voice input to text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
    2. Conversational Response Generation
        ◦ Generates conversational responses using Groq's llama3-8b-8192 language model.
    3. Text-to-Speech Conversion
        ◦ Converts the generated response back to speech using gTTS.
    4. Interactive User Interface
        ◦ Built using Gradio for an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
    5. Real-Time Communication
        ◦ Facilitates smooth, end-to-end voice interactions.
